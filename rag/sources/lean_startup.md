# The Lean Startup Methodology

The Lean Startup methodology is a scientific approach to creating and managing startups that focuses on rapid iteration and customer feedback. It was first introduced by Eric Ries in his 2011 book, "The Lean Startup". The core idea is to shorten product development cycles by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning. This approach aims to reduce the risk of building a product that nobody wants and to help startups grow with maximum acceleration.

### Key Principles:

*   **Build-Measure-Learn:** This is the fundamental feedback loop of the Lean Startup. The process starts with an idea, which is then turned into a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The MVP is a basic version of the product that allows the team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. The startup then measures customer response and learns whether to pivot (change strategy) or persevere with the original plan.
*   **Validated Learning:** Startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning is validated by running experiments that test each element of the business's vision.
*   **Innovation Accounting:** This involves using a new kind of accounting to measure progress, set up milestones, and prioritize work.
*   **Entrepreneurs are Everywhere:** The Lean Startup principles can be applied by anyone in any size company.
*   **Entrepreneurship is Management:** A startup is an institution that requires a new kind of management geared to its context of extreme uncertainty.

### Stages of the Lean Startup Model:

1.  **Business Model Canvas:** This is a tool to help visualize and design a business model.
2.  **Formulating Hypotheses:** Identifying the assumptions that need to be tested.
3.  **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** Building the simplest version of the product to test the hypotheses.
4.  **Learning:** Analyzing the data from the MVP to learn and make decisions.

### Notable Examples:

*   **Dropbox:** Before building their entire platform, the founders created a simple video to explain the concept and gauge interest.
*   **Slack:** Originally an internal tool for a gaming company, the team pivoted to create the popular team communication platform based on user feedback.
*   **YouTube:** Started as a video-dating site before pivoting to focus on video sharing.
