    "llm_response": "We discussed the importance of the Build-Measure-Learn Loop and decision-making between Pivot or Persevere based on feedback for your startup MVP. For the MVP strategy, it is recommended to start small with a focused product, ship fast even if imperfect, and gather user feedback for iteration. The tech stack for your startup MVP includes frontend technologies like React or Vue.js, backend technologies like Node.js or Python, databases like PostgreSQL or Firebase, and deployment platforms like Vercel or Heroku. Additionally, we highlighted key Y Combinator startup advice, such as focusing on high-touch user acquisition, launching early with flaws, and conducting weekly feedback loops with users."
